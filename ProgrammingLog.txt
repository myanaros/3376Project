The group met up on Thursday, April 2nd, and discussed several ways to approach the project. We outlined the classes, and some possible methods in each.
We created a Github project and split up the classes accordingly.
Pablo set up and implemented the Makefile and StatKeeper class and header.
Travis set up and implemented the Queue and BoolSource class and header.
Mark set up and implemented the Airplane and Runway class and header, also constructed the skeleton for airsim.
Each member reviewed other's code and revised if necessary.
