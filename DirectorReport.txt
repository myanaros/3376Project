Airport Director,

  We have completed the airport simulator and ran the simulation. In our

simulation for one airfield we assumed that it would take an airplane 5 minutes

to land, 7 minutes to takeoff and would crash after waiting 20 minutes to land.

We simulated a 50% chance of an aircraft arriving and needing to land, and a 40%

chance that an aircraft would be ready to start itâ€™s departure every minute. The

simulation was ran to last 360 minutes, from 6pm to midnight.

  The results show that we need to add at least 3 other airfields. At a total of

four airfields the average landing time is much less than 5 minutes. This is the

maximum time an aircraft can be in the landing queue before crashing, meaning

that with four airfields total there would be room for growth in the number of

flights that can be handled without crashes. This will also allow the airport to

run more efficiently with having a fewer amount of flight delays.

Respectfully,

The Simulation Team.
